# 4e User Empowerment

## Overview of User Empowerment

Adopting Power Platform necessitates that user support go far beyond help desk services. How do we provide on-boarding and community management to our power users, citizen developers, and business owners? How do we grow and enable a vibrant user group community within the organization?
The Power Platform Adoption Framework assumes, that we understand the possibilities of Power Platform as a fundamental change towards how we think about our work. Rather than understanding it in a conservative, transactional kind of way, whereas there exists a gap between business and IT, Power Platform gives everybody the chance to bring value to your business goals. Here we’re concerned with empowering users to achieve their best work, so they can take advantage of the no-code/low-code tools the platform offers.
This results in better (because more on point) software with shorter development cycles as well as more ideas, because we involve everybody and don’t rely on the IT department. This is about a transitioning from a legacy model in which IT was the "giver of things" to a forward-thinking, user centric model in which IT is the "enabler of people"
Keeping that in mind, an ongoing nurturing of a community around Power Platform is crucial for the development of our business. The dimensions for this pillar are:

- Onboarding Stakeholders
- Offer training
- Tiered support
- Community Nurturing

## Dimensions of User Empowerment

### Onboarding Stakeholders

There are three different target audiences with three different requirements regarding user empowerment, which is very important to realize before you think about the onboarding process:

- User and Business Decision Maker
- Administrator
- Citizen Developer/Pro Developer

It's best practice to have your Administrator on board before you think about User Empowerment in the first place, because a well structured foundation is needed in order to implement Power Platform for any kind of user. Therefore the Administrator group will be excluded in this chapter.

#### Onboarding Citizen and Pro Devs

Regardless of the organizational size, a good onboarding process starts with a welcome mail. Even in small organization a mail has the benefit of containing all useful links and resources the maker will need to start with using Power Platform. Of course the onboarding process doesn't have to be carried by mail, it can also be a kick off workshop, a bot guiding user through the process in a Microsoft Teams channel or any other kind of process. Some kind of documentation does help to re-read the onboarding steps and finding links to the material though.

In the onboarding phase the stakeholder are addressed for the first time, so it's necessary to **introduce Power Platform** in general as well as the plans for the organization. Why is Power Platform introduced and what are the main goals with it. What is to be accomplished by that?

Since Citizen Developer and Pro Developer should be able to participate to build solution, it is important to explain the **process**, reflecting your organizational setup. Do you need to be in a special security group, do you have a certain environment concept in place, how is the building process supposed to look like?

If you already have **app templates or components** in place, the respective library should be mentioned in this mail as well. Maker can use this library to reverse engineer components and apps, contribute new solutions and components to it and accelerate their building process by using bits and pieces for their solutions.

Maker who start with Power Platform need some kind of **training**. The Power Platform Adoption Framework strongly recommends to use the "...in a day" training from Microsoft to give makers a good start. This is necessary for Citizen Developer as well as for Pro Developer. A technical background and education does help with getting the concept, yet Power Platform uses it's own syntax and processes that need to be learned by everybody.

While utilizing Power Platform the stakeholders will have questions and need for support. Therefore a place to get help needs to be inherited into the onboarding mail. This can include an IT Helpdesk, a Power Platform community or a library to online resources.

#### Onboarding User and Business Decision Maker

User and Business Decision Maker do have different needs and requirements when it comes to Power Platform. As the name suggests these groups are using the solutions, rather than building them. Therefore the onboarding process looks a little bit different than the one from the people who actively engage in building solutions:

User who should benefit from Power Platform solutions need to be **introduced to the Power Platform** in general as well. Why is Power Platform introduced and what are the main goals with it. What is to be accomplished by that?

Therefore they need to know what Power Platform solutions there are and how to use them. It is useful to describe the environment concept (if it is relevant for user) and where to find the **app catalogue**.

Quite often user are the expert when it comes to certain business areas and therefore have a very good idea what a solution might contain to actually improve the work process. That's why it is crucial to describe how user can **bring in new ideas** when it comes to Power Platform solutions. The Power Platform mindset aims to empower everybody to achieve their best work and bring value to the organizational business goals.
For example, it is possible to use a certain email address to submit new ideas or develop an app for that. Another great way to integrate the user into the Power Platform development is through the **community**. This is the place to discuss ideas and exchange thoughts on Power Platform solutions.

When onboarding User and Business Decision Maker there should be the possibility to join the Power Platform Program and become a Citizen Developer as well. A process needs to be in place and the user need a way to register.

### Offer Training

Power Platform uses it's own syntax (Power FX) and everybody who want's to build No-Code/Low-Code solutions needs to learn how this works. Microsoft marketing often says that it's easy and intuitive, yet learning time is mandatory. If Pro Developer have a strong tech background and can build apps and flows based on multiple different programming languages, doesn't necessarily mean that Power Platform comes easy.
Microsoft offers ![Power Platform In a Day workshops](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/training-workshops/) which are an excellent starting point. Additionally there are a lot of resources on ![Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/powerplatform/).

Offering training overlaps with other possibilities to implement learning opportunities in an organization. Power Platform thrives through a great community worldwide who's members offer blogs, videos and other projects to learn from. Participating in online events, visiting conferences and exchanging with the community often has a great impact of employers working with Power Platform. Also an internal Power Platform community helps to establish a Power Platform mindset.

The Power Platform Adoption Framework strongly advises to keep in mind, that adopting new skills takes time and mental capacity. Scheduling a training is not enough. Citizen Developer as well as Pro Developer need time and opportunity to learn and inherit new skills in order to build valuable solutions with Power Platform. Business Decision Maker and manager need to realize that this time needs to be made available.

### Tiered Support

Tiered Support is a difficult, yet important part to think of when it comes to User Empowerment. There will be questions and Citizen Developer as well as Pro Developer will get frustrated when they feel there is no real support for their needs. A Power Platform adoption process can rely on that. As mentioned earlier, the introduction of a Power Platform community is a very important part and this community can also function as a first level support. Different people have different skills and an exchange within a community can benefit multiple people.
Nevertheless it is important to implement a proper IT helpdesk with a ticket system to address the need for support regarding Power Platform solutions.

### Community Nurturing

Since we are aiming to implement Power Platform in the organization as a own valuable part, a community is an important part of User Empowerment and Adoption.
When a thriving community exists, member can share solutions, questions and even additional resources found online. It is possible to connect the Support into the community and many organizations think about the community as a first level support. The community is the place where all the resources are stored, the process of building solutions is documented and Citizen Developer, Pro Developer and User can come together to share experiences and even discuss ideas for new solutions. As mentioned earlier it is beneficial to now rely on the IT only to develop solutions or even the ideas. Quite often the user from the business are experts when it comes to improve the work process through a Power Platform solution. A community can be a good place to include everybody from the whole organization.
Possible community platforms can be:

- Power Platform Teams
- Yammer group
- SharePoint Site
- an already existing intranet
