# Power Platform Adoption Framework
More and more organizations are transforming their business in the cloud. They are modernizing legacy enterprise applications with enterprise-grade capabilities such as Microsoftâ€™s Common Data Service (CDS), and they are bringing rogue IT and quasi-apps out of the shadows. Organizations are empowering citizen developers to connect siloed data, engage customers, and drive return on investment (ROI) with robust solutions in PowerApps, Power BI, Flow, the CDS, and Dynamics 365.

Mature organizations understand that rigor, discipline, and best practices are required to fully adopt the platform at scale.

<b>The Power Platform Adoption Framework is the start-to-finish approach for adopting the platform at scale.</b> It has become the global community standard for adoption, buildout, road mapping, enterprise management and governance of Power Platform at scale within enterprise-grade organizations.
